This is an attempt to apply generative adversarial networks to faces of "non - white" persons.

Artificially generated faces could be big in the educational space, among other things. Having most faces used to generate these images be mostly white gives a wrong representation of the variety (in many forms) of human faces (and, by extension, human beings). A quick perusal of https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/ shows that most (if not all!) of the faces generated are "white".

This could mean Latino kids only see white faces in their (next - gen) intelligent educational software that was designed to give them personalized, highly effective learning. This is unacceptable both from a practical and inclusion perspective.

I will update this description with an article on my thought process for this.

This project will seek to gather faces of all kinds of persons, especially non-white, both online and crowdsourced; and then generate artificial faces from these.

This will be an open - source project, available for any and all kinds of people to contribute. So, feel free to contribute!
